## 🎨 Stylized Depth-Based Color Blending
Smooth, natural color transitions based on water depth:
- Shallow → warm tones
- Deep → cool tones

---

## 🔍 Screen-Space Refraction
Fully adjustable refraction effects through material properties:
- Refraction scale
- Distortion speed
- Distortion strength

---

## 🌫️ Dynamic Shoreline Foam
Foam intensity reacts smoothly to world geometry:
- Scene depth
- Camera view
- Terrain proximity

---

## ⚡ Optimized for Performance
Shader Graph–only implementation suitable for all platforms:
- No custom HLSL
- Efficient on PC
- Efficient on Mobile
- Efficient on VR and low-end hardware
